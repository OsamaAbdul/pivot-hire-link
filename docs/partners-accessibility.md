# Partners Page Accessibility Report

## Landmarks & Hierarchy
- H1 heading followed by grid of partner cards.
- Navbar provides navigation with semantic links.

## Labels & Alt Text
- Logo mark is decorative; implemented as styled divs without redundant alt text.
- Links are descriptive; footer links are clear.

## Keyboard Navigation
- All nav links are keyboard-focusable with visible hover/focus styles via tokenized colors.

## Contrast
- Dark theme tokens ensure contrast above WCAG AA for body text.
- Mint accent is not used for large text blocks; primarily decorative.

## Known Deviations
- Partner logos are represented by stylized blocks (no proprietary assets). This preserves layout while avoiding licensing issues.

## Recommendations
- Replace stylized logos with partner-provided SVGs including meaningful alt text once assets are available.
