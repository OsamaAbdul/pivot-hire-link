# About Us Page — Accessibility Report

## Landmarks
- Page uses semantic sections and a visible navigation via shared `Navbar`.
- Footer provides supplemental navigation links.

## Headings
-- Hero uses `h1` with clear, descriptive text.
-- Sections use `h2` for "Our Mission" and "Our Pillars".

## Color & Contrast
-- Dark theme colors meet WCAG AA for text against gradient backgrounds.
-- Accent color used for emphasis does not reduce contrast for body copy.

## Keyboard Navigation
-- Interactive elements (buttons, links) are reachable and operable via keyboard.
-- Hover effects are non-essential; focus states rely on default button and link outlines.

## Screen Readers
-- Icons in pillar cards are decorative; no extra labels required.
-- CTA button has clear text "Join the Hunt" and navigates to signup.

## Modals & Auth
-- Auth page includes close button and proper focus management via native form controls.

## Known Deviations
-- Partner logos are stylized placeholders in other pages; About page uses icons only.
